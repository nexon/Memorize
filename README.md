# Stanford | CS193p - Developing Apps for iOS 2020

This Repo is for the project that do following the [Stanford CS193p Course 2020](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/) dictated by Paul Hegarty.

## About CS193p



Stanford's CS193p course, Developing Applications for iOS, explains the fundamentals of how to build applications for iPhone and iPad using SwiftUI.  Most recently offered in Spring quarter 2020, the lectures were given to Stanford students in an on-line format due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. Stanford is in the process of making these on-line lecture videos available for all via YouTube (two per week).

On this site, you will be able to find materials that were distributed to students during the quarter such as homework assignment write-ups and demo code.  Unfortunately, we cannot offer any of the same kind of direct support we gave our students (on-line Q&A and office hours with teaching staff, homework grading, etc.), but the materials posted here should still be helpful in understanding the lectures as you watch.  As we emphasize to our students, doing the homework assignments is absolutely essential to learning the material in this course.

SwiftUI is brand new, having only shipped a few months before this course was taught.  Thus it may well be that by the time you are watching it, some of the course's content will already be out of date as updates to SwiftUI occur, requiring some adjustment as you watch.  That is normal for new technology.

The material in this course was not developed with the involvement of, nor was it vetted by, anyone at Apple, so it should not be perceived as "the truth" for how to develop using SwiftUI.  We've done our best to understand this technology ourselves in the short time it has been out and then share what we've learned.  Enjoy!
